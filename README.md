## Nature-Inspired Swarm Optimization for Semantic Web Security

This repository contains the computational implementation for the research paper "Nature-Inspired Swarm Optimization Paradigms for Securing Semantic Web Frameworks against DDoS Attacks." The project presents a novel approach to protect Semantic Web frameworks from Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks using nature-inspired swarm optimization algorithms. It models network behavior and employs a collective of "agents" to detect anomalies and mitigate attacks in real-time by dynamically adjusting security parameters.
